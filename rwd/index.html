    <h1>Responsiv Web Design</h1>
    <p>Responsive web design (RWD) or responsive design is an approach to web design that aims to make web pages render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes from minimum to maximum display size to ensure usability and satisfaction.
    In responsive design, you can define rules for how the content flows and how the layout changes based on the size range of the screen. Responsive designs respond to changes in browser width by adjusting the placement of design elements to fit in the available space.
